Basically Basic is a [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) meant as a substitute for the default --- [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). Conventions and features found there are fully supported by **Basically Basic**, with a few enhancements thrown in for good measure:

- Clean responsive design with [six customizable skins](#skin)
- Curriculum Vit√¶/Resume layout powered by [JSON data](http://registry.jsonresume.org/)
